THIS IS A HOME AUTOMATION WITH BLUETOOTH TASK IN THIS I DEVELOPED A BLUETOOTH-CONTROLLED HOME ZAUTOMATION SYSTEM USING TINKERCAD AS A SIMULATION PALTFORM.TO SIMULATE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF SWITCHING HOME APPLIANCES ON AND OFF THROUGH BLUETOOTH COMMANDS,MIMICKING A REAL-TIME SMART HOME ENVIRONMENT.TO DESIGN AND SIMULATE A SMART HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM THAT CAN BE CONTROLLED WIRELESSLY THROUGH BLUETOOTH USING AURDINO AND DEMONSTRATE IT THROUGH AN ONLINE SIMULATION PLATFORM-TINKERCAD.THE COMPONENTS I USED IN THIS TASK ARE AURDINO,LED,SERIAL MONITOR,RESISTORS,CONNECTING WIRES,BREAD BOARD.SINCE TINKERCAD DOES NOT SUPPORT BLUETOOTH MODULES LIKE HC-05 DIRECTLY,I USED THE SERIAL MONITOR AS SUBSTITUTE TO SIMULATE BLUETOOTH COMMUNICATION.THE LOGIC REMAINS THE SAME SPECIFIC CHARACTERS ARE SENT VIA THE SERIAL MONITOR,WHICH THE AURDINO READS AND RESPONDS TO BY TURNING LED ON OR OFF.THE LED IS CONNECTED TO A DIGITAL PIN ON THE AURDINO,SIMULATING THE CONTROL OF HOUSEHOLD DEVICES.THE POGRAM TOGGLES SPECIFIC DIGITAL PINS HIGH OR LOW TO TURN THE LED ON OR OFF.THE CODE IS SIMPLE,WELL-COMMENTED THE CORE FUNCTIONALITY OF BLUETOOTH-CONTROLLED AUTOMATION.USIN TINKERCAD,I CREATED A NEAT AND UNDERSTABLE CIRCUIT.LED ARE CONNECTED TO DIGITAL PIN WITH 220-OHM RESISTORS,SIMULATING APPLIANCES.THE SERIAL MONITOR WAS USED TO MANUALLY INPUT COMMANDS,EFFECTIVELY DEMONSTRATING HOW BLUETOOTH COMMANDS WOULD FUNCTION IN REAL HARDWARE.I DELIVERED THE CIRCUIT DIAGRAM,AURDINO CODE,SERIAL MONITOR TEST SHOWING LED SWITCHING IN GITHUB REPOSITORY WITH CODE AND IMAGES OF CIRCUIT DIAGRAM AND SERIAL MONITOR.THIS TASK WAS A VALUABLE LEARNING EXPERIENCE IN EMBEDDED SYSTEM DESIGN AND SIMULATION.BY SIMULATING A BLUETOOTH CONTROLLED HOME AUTOMATION USING TINKERCAD,I DEMONSTRATED THE WORKIG LOGIC EFFECTIVELY IN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.ALTOUGH ACTUAL BLUETOOTH MODULES WEREN'T USED,THE PROJECT  SUCCESSFULLY FULFILLED THE OBJECTIVE USING ALTERNATING SIMULATION METHODS.IT LAID A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE PROJECTS INVOLVING WIRELESS CONTROL AND REAL TIME IOT  APPLICATIONS.THIS TASK IMPROVED MY UNDERSTANDING OF SERIAL COMMUNICATION,CONDITIONAL PROGRAMMING AND CIRCUIT SIMMULATION.ALL REQUIRED DELIVERABLES INCLUDING THE AURDINO CODE,CIRCUIT DIAGRAM HAVE BEEN STORED IN GITHUB.ALTHOUGH PHYSICALBLUETOOTH MODULES COULDN'T BE USED,THIS TASK SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED THE  CONCEPT OF BLUETOOTH-BASED HOME AUTOMATION USING TINKERCAD.BY USING SERIAL MONITOR,I COULD SIMULATE SENDING COMMANDS AS IF THEY WERE RECEIVED FROM A MOBILE APP.THIS METHOD WAS A GREAT ALTERNATIVE FOR PRACTICING EMBEDDED SYSTEM LOGIC IN AN ONLINE ENVIRONMENT. I DELIVERED THE DEVICE ON OR OFF IN IN THE FORM OF SCREENSHOT AND UPLOADED IN GITHUB.
